# Gemini API Rate Limit Management

## Current Configuration

The application has been updated with the following improvements to handle Gemini API rate limits:

### 1. **Model Switch**
- **Before:** `gemini-1.5-pro` (stricter limits)
- **After:** `gemini-1.5-flash` (higher limits, faster responses)

### 2. **Rate Limiting Features**
- ✅ **Concurrent Request Limiting:** Max 2 simultaneous requests
- ✅ **Minimum Interval:** 2 seconds between requests
- ✅ **Exponential Backoff:** Smart retry with increasing delays
- ✅ **Better Error Messages:** Clear explanations of rate limit issues

### 3. **Free Tier Limits (gemini-1.5-flash)**
- **Requests per minute:** 15
- **Requests per day:** 1,500
- **Tokens per minute:** 1 million
- **Tokens per day:** 50 million

## What Changed

### Rate Limiting Logic
```javascript
// New rate-limited analysis function
analyzeImageWithRateLimit(imageBuffer, mimeType)
```

### Error Handling
- Detects rate limit errors (429 status)
- Provides clear user-friendly messages
- Implements exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s, up to 60s)
- Falls back gracefully when limits are exceeded

### Optimizations
- Lower temperature (0.1) for consistent responses
- Limited output tokens (4096) to reduce quota usage
- Better logging for monitoring API usage

## Usage Tips

### For Development
1. **Upload images one at a time** rather than bulk uploads
2. **Wait 2-3 seconds between uploads** if doing multiple
3. **Monitor the terminal** for rate limit warnings

### If You Hit Rate Limits
1. **Wait 1-2 minutes** before trying again
2. **Consider upgrading** to a paid Gemini API plan for higher limits
3. **Use smaller images** to reduce token usage

### For Production
- Consider implementing a queue system for background processing
- Add user notifications when analysis is delayed due to rate limits
- Implement a paid API plan for higher throughput

## Error Messages You Might See

- **Rate Limit:** "Gemini API rate limit exceeded. Please wait a few minutes..."
- **API Key:** "Gemini API key issue. Please check your API key configuration."
- **Safety Filter:** "Image content flagged by safety filters. Please try a different image."

## Monitoring

The application now logs:
- When analysis starts: `Starting Gemini analysis with model: gemini-1.5-flash`
- When analysis completes: `Gemini analysis completed successfully with X feedback items`
- Rate limit warnings: `Rate limit hit. Waiting Xs before retry...`

## Next Steps

If you continue to hit rate limits frequently, consider:
1. **Upgrading to Gemini API Pro** for higher limits
2. **Implementing a background job queue** for processing
3. **Adding user notifications** for processing status
4. **Caching analysis results** to avoid re-processing the same images
